Touhou in Geometry Dash: Shattered Crystal Shards

Uses G.js and WSLiveEditor as a means to export generated objects directly into Geometry Dash.

This repo deals with pattern generation and other automated tasks that require generating hundreds of triggers with specific values and groups.
It mainly uses 'components', a Builder-pattern like architecture for creating trigger and managing trigger functions.

This is a solo project I took on as both a passion project and technical challenge. I thought that building a game within a more limited game was both more impressive, technically challenging, and more interesting then your typical Unity slop game (no hate to yall).

I am currently working on creating dev logs on Youtube for the game's development progress.

For any inquiries relating to this project, contact me on Discord at @xtreme420.
There is also a chance I reply on github if I somehow see it.
