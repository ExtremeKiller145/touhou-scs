## NEW SYSTEM ##

Keep stage practice in mind: 
all spells are modular and should be able to run in a vacuum

TODO:

Luau Migration
Multi-target system (using the baseRadialComponent)

Better Trigger spread (not needed for a while)
It will fix any possible 'missing bullet' bugs that come from systems like multitrigger (despite being non-spawn-ordered and non-ordered, if they randomly bunch up it sometimes seems to skip one)

Misc.lua systems (collision triggers especially)

Within lib.lua:
Add remaining trigger like stop trigger, alpha trigger, etc.
Add spread function to manipulate each spell's x and y positions to prevent clustering lag

Auto Scale Trigger Reset Validation (optional, complicated but possible): 
make a system that goes through all triggers, creates an execution tree (i.e tracks spawn trigger chains) and looks to see if a scale trigger's reset would ever get run AFTER the bullet is triggered again elsewhere.


Test activation/deactivation conditions for toggle/collision triggers
Test arc and radialwave. Radial tested

Health system
3 Character movement profiles --> has been set, not finalized

GROUP/OBJ BUDGET:
Groups (9999 limit): 
 
Bullet types: 3,000 - 5,000 
Pickups: 300 - 500 
Player shots: 1,050 - 1,800 
Common enemies: 544 - 1,000 
Total usage: 4,894 - 8,300 groups 
Remaining: 1,699 - 5,105 groups 
Objects (250k target): 
 
Current: 20k 
Spells: 10k - 30k 
Common enemies: 11k - 36k 
Player shots: 1.5k - 4k 
Backgrounds: 2k - 5k (massively reduced!) 
UI: 3k - 8k 
Visual effects: 5k - 10k 
Total projected: 52.5k - 113k objects 
Remaining budget: 137k - 197k objects 
Analysis: 
 
Best case: Only 21% object usage - tons of headroom 
Worst case: 45% object usage - still very comfortable 
Background savings: Freed up 13k-20k objects for gameplay polish
