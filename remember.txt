## NEW SYSTEM ##

Keep stage practice in mind: 
all spells are modular and should be able to run in a vacuum

TODO:


Better Trigger spread (not needed for a while)


Within lib.lua:

Auto Scale Trigger Reset Validation (optional, complicated but possible): 
make a system that goes through all triggers, creates an execution tree (i.e tracks spawn trigger chains) and looks to see if a scale trigger's reset would ever get run AFTER the bullet is triggered again elsewhere.
