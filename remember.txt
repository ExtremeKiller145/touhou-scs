Remember these things:

Trigger adding: on per spell basis configureNewSpell creates a new index in triggerGroups[] 
in which all triggers of the same spell will be in the same list. at the end, a function is called to add all triggers, where it is automatically scattered to prevent clustering/obj_density & lag

New Spell: be aware of durations for scale triggers & re-use other spells for efficiency using remaps 
,
Difficulties:
When choosing a difficulty toggle off all spells, toggle on the spells for the difficulty, or the triggers within the spells
For stage practice,
