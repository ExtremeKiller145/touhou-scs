Remember these things:

Trigger adding: on per spell basis configureNewSpell creates a new index in triggerGroups[] 
in which all triggers of the same spell will be in the same list. at the end, a function is called to add all triggers, where it is automatically scattered to prevent clustering/obj_density & lag

New Spell: be aware of durations for scale triggers & re-use other spells for efficiency using remaps

Within library.js:

Finish ConfigureNewSpell
Finish testing ColorShift
Finish adding all other useful triggers
Set all Y positions in those to 0. let the insert function clean it upon compilation
